# C# MiniLessons Repository

Welcome to the C# MiniLessons repository! This repository contains concise and focused lessons covering various advanced topics in C#. Currently, the lessons revolve around "Source Generation" and "Parsing Strings to C# Code using Roslyn Compiler."

## Topics Covered

### 1. Source Generation
In this section, you'll learn about the concept of source generation in C#. Source generation allows you to generate C# source code at compile time, enabling powerful scenarios such as automatic code generation, reducing boilerplate, and enhancing performance.

#### Lessons:
- Writing Source Generators in C#
- Practical Use Cases

### 2. Parsing Strings to C# Code using Roslyn Compiler
This section delves into leveraging the Roslyn compiler to parse strings into executable C# code. Roslyn, the open-source .NET Compiler Platform, enables dynamic code generation and manipulation, providing insights into the inner workings of the C# compiler.

#### Lessons:
- Understanding Roslyn Compiler API
- Converting Strings to Syntax Trees
